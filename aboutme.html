            <p>My name is Ian, My favorite color is blue. I really love dogs and actually have 3. I have an all white german shepherd, doberman, and a siberian husky.</p>
            <p>My shepherd's name is Ritz, my doberman's name is Rex, and my husky's name is Luna. I love to skate when I can, but I also love to ride my bike. Another thing that I really love to do is drawing or painting.</p>
            <p>I really love to make music, and listen to it. I listen to music nearly all day, every day. I have also been programming for over 6 years with different languages.</p>
