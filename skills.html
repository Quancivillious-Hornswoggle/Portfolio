            <p>Over time, I learned a good amount of skills. I know many different programming languages. In addition to programming I can also play a few instruments. The instruments I play are guitar, bass, and drums.</p>
            <p>Im a decent artist, I can't draw much, but if it's a certain style, I can be somewhat good.</p>
            <p>I can understand stuff pretty well, fairly quickly. I self taught myself mutiple programming languages and taught myself other stuff.</p>
            <p>The stuff I develop best are desktop applications, however I can also make server side programs, or even games using the Unity engine.</p>
